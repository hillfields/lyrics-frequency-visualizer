(Your current escape…
You can’t escape
Tell me, tell me)

How are you feeling? I’m Soso.
Haven’t you noticed it yet?
What? Are you curious?
I’m ok, you worry more than me.

What? What? What? What is going on?
Calm, calm, calm down
You can only ask questions? (What is that mouth for?)
Don’t make a fool of me.
I’m talking to you.

Ayy, go fxxk you self.

昇り詰めてきた　後悔を振り払うように
無縁の由縁を　巡らせては逆戻り徐々に遠のいて (moumodorenai.)
全てを捨て此処に居たいんでしょう？
You don’t mind relying on medicine.
Not seen by anyone.

Why are you getting so heated? Just. (Do not worry.)
Even if what you are talking about? w
It’s about you drinking poisoned juice. What?
