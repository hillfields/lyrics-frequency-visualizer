Yes there is no doubt in this world we’re always free
And there is nothing better than an “I Love You”
makes you gush with glee
Just wrap it with ribbons and make a smile, it’s nothing ah hah
Your words are the treat that I am waiting for, “lovely” ah hah

Deep down from my heart here is my present, oh
Sincerely from me here is my present, oh
Just take it from me there is nothing more
The love that I got, it’s an open door

Don’t even ask what the present’s about
The present’s about surprising your heart
Even if the date becomes a nightmare
Whatever mood you’re in I got the best in the world present

Yes there is a thing that we find ourselves being clean
no matter what you’ve gotta say an “I Love It” but it’s how it is
all kinds of ribbons will make it look,  so pretty ah hah
gonna make you hype like getting it for the first time so hyper ah hah

Deep down from my heart here is my present, oh
Sincerely from me here is my present, oh
Just take it from me there is nothing more
the city is singing with joy of love

easiest feelings are hard to express so I’m
giving you my true love in wrappings dear
love’s unconditional
I’ve found those words are true and you’re
the one that made me realize this love

Don’t even ask what the present’s about
The present’s about surprising your heart
Even if every day seems like okay
the things that you don’t realize is what it’s about
you and me together is the most brilliant present

Deep down from my heart here is my present, oh
Sincerely from me here is my present, oh
